# PROJECT-Neighborhood-Map
##Project Overview

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
Why this Project?

The neighborhood tour application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.
What will I Learn?

You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

##How does this help my Career?

- Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
- Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged


##How will I complete this Project?

1. Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
2. Download the Knockout framework.
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
4. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
5. Implement the search bar functionality to search your map markers.
6. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
7. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
